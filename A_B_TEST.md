 ## Tools used ##
 ### Jupyter notebook###

 
 ## OVERVIEW ##
 #### For this project, I used e-commerce webiste data source to run A/B test.  The company want to know how's the CRV changed after new page launched and aslo use Statistics information to help company to make decision. My goal is to use bootstrapping sampling distribution, p_value and regression to help achive the goal . 
 ## Part I - probability##
 #### To find probabilities of converting  for control and treatment group and get some basic stats. information for further research. ####
 ## Part II -A/B test ##
 #### A/B Hypothesis testing will be used for assuming the old page is same or better the new page. Conclusion beased on P-value. ####
 ## Part III - Regression##
 #### To use Multiple linear regression to asses for interactions of independent variables. ####
 
 ## Finding##
 ### * There is no significant difference for conversion rate between new_page and old_page.###
 ### * The countryvariable did not impact on the rate of convertion between new_page and old_page.###
 ### * aslo checked VIF  to make sure multicollinearity has been removed.##
